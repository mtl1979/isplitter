# isplitter

Image Splitter is a simple Qt-based tool to split individual images from a 
image collage. It can rotate and resize the collage before removing borders
that surround the entire collage or individual images in a collage. It 
initially assumes all images in the collage are of same size and alignment,
but cropping, and horizontal and vertical offsets, can be adjusted per image
before saving.

## Building

Image Splitter should build without changes under Windows with Microsoft
Visual C++ 2010-2015 and Qt 4.8-4.8.7. It should also build with minimal
changes under most Linux distributions with Qt4 development
packages installed.
